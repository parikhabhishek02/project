# project: zumo mobile robot for object tracking and following
step:1 make components list and find resources
step:2 make connection layout of robot
step:3 decide interfacing between microcontrollers
step:4 download the documents and API and SDK files
step:5 connect LPC through Host and import all Sdk files
step:6 start programming for motors through LPC
step:7 make a push button code for motors to check
step:8 check your code with oscilloscope for pwm signals
step:9 if code debugs than load it in LPC
step:10 make a small connection with DC motors and push button to run the LPC code
step:11 try to run motor with push button for trial of forward, reverse, speed up and speed down
step:12 get PIXY camera and try to connect through beaglebone black 
step:13 try to make pixy recognize objects wit different colors with inbuilt programs.
