Overview
========
The usart_dma example shows how to use usart driver with DMA:

In this example, one usart instance connect to PC through usart, the board will
send back all characters that PC send to the board.

Note: The example echo every 8 characters, so input 8 characters every time.
Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso54114 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special is needed.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (J7) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings (See Appendix A in Getting started guide for description how to determine serial port number):
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the CMSIS DAP terminal like:
